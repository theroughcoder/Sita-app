# Sita app

## Overview
The user has been assigned 10 todo items and the aim of this project is to allow the user to view the status of the items in smaller groups.

Here the user is viewing the status of all his 10 to-do Items in two groups: 
Group1 has status of items 1 and 2; 
Group2 has status of items from 3 to 10. 

The status of items in each group is shown next to the group (for example: item 1 is done, item 2 is not done)
